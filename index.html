      <h1>Their Sober Press</h1>
      <p>
        Their Sober Press is an anonymous fellowship of alcoholics with support from non-alcoholics who "remix" sober
        literature to make them more inclusive for people of all genders, sexual orientations, and religious beliefs. It
        is our sincere hope that these small changes help make 12 step programs accessible to people who formerly felt
        unwelcome due to the language of the central texts. Our work is not authorized by the AA General Service Board,
        AA World Service Board, or any related enterprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not for profit and do not accept outside donations. If any literature here has helped you get and stay
        sober, please contribute to a local twelve step group (e.g. through the 7th Tradition collection.)

        So far, we have remixed the 12 steps in the book
        <em>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions<em>—aka <em>The 12&12</em>—and most of the chapters of the first 164
        pages of the book <em>Alcoholic Anonymous</em>—aka<em>The Big Book</em>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="twelve-and-twelve">Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Currently the Twelve Steps are 100% completed, and the Twelve Traditions are 0% completed. The Twelve Traditions
        are scheduled to be worked on after the first 164 pages of <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> are completed.

      <p>
        We will only be remixing the first 164 pages of the <em>Big Book</em>. The rest of the pages are personal
        stories of recovery and will not be included in the final PDF. We actively working on finishing this remix and
        are approximately three-quarters the way through.
