      <h1>Their Sober Press</h1>
      <p>
        Their Sober Press is an anonymous fellowship of alcoholics with support from non-alcoholics who “remix” sober
        literature to make them more inclusive for people of all genders, sexual orientations, and religious beliefs. It
        is our sincere hope that these small changes help make 12 step programs accessible to people who formerly felt
        unwelcome due to exclusionary language in the central texts. Our work is not authorized by the AA General
        Service Board, AA World Service Board, or any related organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not for profit and do not accept any donations. If any of the literature here has helped you get and stay
        sober, please contribute to a local twelve step group.

      <p>
        So far, we have remixed the 12 steps in the book <em>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</em>—commonly
        referred to as <em>The 12&12</em>—and the first 164 pages of the book <em>Alcoholic Anonymous</em>—commonly
        referred to as <em>The Big Book</em>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="twelve-and-twelve">Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions (the 12&12)</h3>
      <p>
        Presently, we have completed the first twelve chapters of the book, i.e. the “Twelve Steps,” and bound them
        into a PDF. We are just starting on the latter half of the book, the “Twelve Traditions.”

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Their Sober Press recognizes why numerous AA members and service committees are reticent to change the language
        from the original AA literature. AA and other twelve step programs have saved countless individuals from dying
        of their addictions. Why would we risk changing the “magic formula” that has helped so many people get and stay
        sober?
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is though, there is nothing sacred about the literature. What gets us sober is a spiritual
        experience, and what keeps us sober is working with other alcoholics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other
        alcoholics. It works when other activities fail.<br />
        <em>—Alcoholic Anonymous, page 89</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What the founding member of Their Sober Press discovered was that many people they worked with felt excluded
        because of how AA literature assumes that: alcoholics are almost always men, women are seldom professionals and
        almost always the stay-at-home caregivers, God is a man, and all relationships are heterosexual. This is not to
        suggest that the original authors meant to exclude people. They were using the common phasing and biases of
        their time. In fact we recognize that they actively took steps to make the program more accommodating. In How It
        Works on page 58 of the book <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em>, it refers to alcoholics as “men and women” and
        refers to a higher powers as “God as we understood Him.” We therefore believe that making the smallest changes
        possible to the text to make it more inclusive without diminishing the message is in line with the precedent set
        down by the founders of AA.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve heard it said that the AA literature has been successful in helping alcoholics for 50 years, and if we
        have a resentment at the way it’s written, then we should write an inventory about it. Our founding member did
        write an inventory about it, prayed about it, talked with their sponsor about it, talked to other alcoholics
        about it, and came to this conclusion: while they had the luxury of writing an inventory about it because they
        had worked the steps, there were countless other suffering alcoholics who would not be able to write such an
        inventory because they wouldn’t feel welcome to AA and leave.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        When anyone, anywhere reaches out for help, [we] want the hand of AA always to be there, and for that [we] are
        responsible.<br />
        <em>—AA Responsibility Pledge</em>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To try to be consistent in our remixing, and to ensure we’re making the smallest possible changes without
        altering the message, we follow a style guide. Our most up-to-date version of the
        <a href="https://github.com/alcoano/their-sober-press/blob/master/styleguide.md">style guide</a> is hosted on
        GitHub.
      </p>
      <h3>Key points from style guide</h3>

      <h4>Gender of God</h4>
      <p class="rule">Avoid using any pronoun when referring to God.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        For any given alcoholic God may be a: he, she, it, they, etc. When we say “God as we understand Him,” we are
        implicitly saying that any concept of God is fine, so long as it’s a man. Other remixes have replaced “God as we
        understood Him” with “our Higher Power as we understood it.” While we agree that this is an inclusive remixing
        of the text, we found it to be too distracting when being read alongside a non-remixed text and found that
        replacing “Him” with “God” to flow more naturally. Moreover, we had noticed that some members of AA already did
        this when reading “How It Works” at the beginning of an AA meeting.
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        God as we understood Him
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        God as we understood God
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Singular they</h4>
      <p class="rule">Replace gendered pronouns with singular they.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        Try to establish singular “they” by having a clear singular subject antecedent. When there are multiple “they”
        pronouns in a sentence, make sure that each usage of “they” has its antecedent appear before any other “they”
        pronouns that refer to different antecedents. Otherwise restate the antecedent.
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can he turn his own will and his own life over to the care of
        whatever God he thinks there is?
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can they turn their own will and their own life over to the
        care of whatever God they think there is?
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        They simply will not budge; they make him desperately unhappy and threaten his newfound sobriety.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        Their problems simply will not budge; they make the alcoholic desperately unhappy and threaten their newfound
        sobriety.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Man and men</h4>

      <p class="rule">Favour using “person” or “people” over “man” or “men.”</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        Also avoid using gendered profession names that end in “man” (e.g. clergyman, businessman.)
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        This brave philosophy, wherein each man plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the
        acid test: how well does it actually work?
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        This brave philosophy, wherein each person plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the
        acid test: how well does it actually work?
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Men and women</h4>
      <p class="rule">Use “people” instead of “men and women.”</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        While these uses are trying to be more inclusive, they still exclude non-binary individuals. Replace “man and
        woman” with something like “person” and “men and women” with “people” or “everyone.”
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step
        Three.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        Every person who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        No adult man or woman, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a parent.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        No adult, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a parent.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Masculine collective nouns</h4>
      <p class="rule">Avoid words that assume a group of people are all male.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        For example: brotherhood and mankind
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less brotherhood than before.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less kinship than before.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Gendered caregivers</h4>
      <p class="rule">Favour “parent” to “father” or “mother.”</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        Often it is assumed that a mother is a stay-at-home caregiver and a father is a breadwinner. Using “parent”
        instead create the space for people of any gender to assume either of these roles.
      </p>

      <h4>Gendered partners</h4>
      <p class="rule">Use “partner” instead of “wife” or “husband.”</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        Often it is assumed that alcoholics are men married to (non-alcoholic) women. This does not reflect reality.
        Alcoholics can be any gender and can be in non-marriage partnerships with people of any gender.
      </p>

      <h4>Pronouns when referring to specific people</h4>
      <p class="rule">Keep gendered pronouns if they refer to specific people.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        We do not want to erase the gender of specific people when they are identified in the original text.
      </p>
      <h5>Unchanged</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-unchanged">
        “So did a friend of mine who was a one-time vice-president of the American Atheist Society, but he got through
        with room to spare.”
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Gendered language in quotes</h4>
      <p class="rule">Remix gendered language in quotes using brackets.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        Because we assume that the authors of AA literature were not intentionally using exclusionary language, it is
        safe to remix this language as long as brackets are used around the changes so as to not misrepresent the person
        being quoted.
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        “THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.” So declares a well-loved clergyman who happens to be
        one of A.A.’s greatest friends.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        “THIS is the Step that separates the [adults] from the [children].” So declares a well-loved clergyperson who
        happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Fellow and fellowship</h4>
      <p class="rule">Using fellow and fellowship is OK.</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        While some dictionaries have archaic or obsolete definitions of fellow as masculine. However,
        <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/fellow">“fellow” itself is etymologically gender neutral</a>.
        In a survey of different online discussion boards, most people tend to agree that fellow in most modern usages
        is gender neutral. Lastly, prior art, <a href="https://www.queerit.co/big-book">Inclusive Big Book</a>, does not
        change instances of “fellow” and “fellows.” Though, there are some instances in the text here, that we have
        remixed
        “fellow” singular into “someone” or “person” when it seemed appropriate.
      </p>

      <h4>Queer</h4>
      <p class="rule">Avoid using the word “queer.”</p>
      <p class="rule-explanation">
        In older AA literature, “queer” is used with its traditional meaning of “odd” or “strange.” In today’s English,
        “queer” is almost always used either (a) to mean someone who identifies outside of the hetero-normative or
        cis-gender-normative paradigms or (b) as a slur to refer to someone who is not straight or cis-gendered. To
        avoid confusion and also to avoid triggering folks who may have had “queer” used as a pejorative towards them,
        we opt to replace “queer” with a different descriptive adjective.
      </p>
      <h5>Original</h5>
      <blockquote class="original-example">
        Show them, from your own experience, how the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal
        functioning of the will power.
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Remixed</h5>
      <blockquote class="remixed-example">
        Show them, from your own experience, how the distorted mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents
        normal functioning of the will power.
