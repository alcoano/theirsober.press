      <h1>Their Sober Press</h1>
      <p>
        Their Sober Press is an anonymous fellowship of alcoholics with support from non-alcoholics who "remix" sober
        literature to make them more inclusive for people of all genders, sexual orientations, and religious beliefs. It
        is our sincere hope that these small changes help make 12 step programs accessible to people who formerly felt
        unwelcome due to the language of the central texts. Our work is not authorized by the AA General Service Board,
        AA World Service Board, or any related enterprise.
      </p>

        We are not for profit and do not accept outside donations. If any literature here has helped you get and stay
        sober, please contribute to a local twelve step group (e.g. through the 7th Tradition collection.)

        So far, we have remixed the 12 steps in the book
        <em>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions<em>—aka <em>The 12&12</em>—and most of the chapters of the first 164
            pages of the book <em>Alcoholic Anonymous</em>—aka<em>The Big Book</em>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="twelve-and-twelve">Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Currently the Twelve Steps are 100% completed, and the Twelve Traditions are 0% completed. The Twelve Traditions
        are scheduled to be worked on after the first 164 pages of <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> are completed.

        We will only be remixing the first 164 pages of the <em>Big Book</em>. The rest of the pages are personal
        stories of recovery and will not be included in the final PDF. We actively working on finishing this remix and
        are approximately three-quarters the way through.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Their Sober Press recognizes why numerous AA members and service committees are reticent to change the language
        from the original AA literature. AA and other twelve step programs have saved countless individuals from dieing
        of their addictions. Why would we risk changing the "magic formula" that has helped so many people get and stay
        sober.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is though, there is nothing sacred about the literature. What gets us sober is a spiritual
        experience, and what keeps us sober is working with other alcoholics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other
        alcoholics. It works when other activities fail.<br />
        <em>—Alcoholic Anonymous, page 89</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What the founding member of Their Sober Press discovered was that many people they worked with felt excluded
        because
        of how AA literature assumes that: alcoholics are almost always men, women are seldom professionals and almost
        always the stay-at-home caregivers, God is a man, and all relationship are heterosexual. This is not to suggest
        that
        the original authors meant to exclude people. They were using the common phasing and biases of their time. In
        fact we recognize that they actively took steps to make the program more accommodating. In How It Works on page
        58 of the
        book <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em>, it refers to alcoholics as "men and women" and refers to a higher powers as
        "God as we understood Him." We therefore believe that making the smallest changes possible to the text to make
        it more inclusive without diminishing the message is in line with the president set down by the founders of AA.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've heard it said that the AA literature has been successful in helping alcoholics for 50 years, and if we
        have a resentment at the way it's written, then we should write an inventory about it. Our founding member did
        write an inventory about it, prayed about it, talked with their sponsor about it, talked to other alcoholics
        about it, and came to this conclusion: while they had the luxury of writing an inventory about it because they
        had worded the steps, there were counts other suffering alcoholics who would not be able to write such an
        inventory because they wouldn't feel welcome to AA and leave.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        When anyone, anywhere reaches out for help. We want the hand of AA always to be there, and for that we are
        responsible.<br />
        —AA Responsibility Pledge

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To try to be consistent in our remixing, and to ensure we're making the smallest possible changes without
        altering the message, we follow a style guide. Our most up-to-date version of the <a
          href="https://github.com/alcoano/their-sober-press/blob/master/styleguide.md">style guide</a> is hosted on
        GitHub.
